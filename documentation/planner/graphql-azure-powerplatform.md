# GraphQL Integration API with Azure App Registration & Power Platform

## Overview
Integrating GraphQL APIs with Azure and Power Platform enables secure, scalable access to data and automation workflows.

## Steps
1. **Register Your App in Azure AD:**
   - Go to Azure Portal > Azure Active Directory > App registrations.
   - Register a new application and note the Client ID, Tenant ID, and Secret.
   - Set API permissions (e.g., Microsoft Graph, custom APIs).
2. **Configure GraphQL API:**
   - Deploy your GraphQL endpoint (e.g., Apollo Server, Hasura).
   - Secure with OAuth2/OpenID Connect using Azure credentials.
3. **Integrate with Power Platform:**
   - In Power Apps/Power Automate, add a custom connector.
   - Use the GraphQL endpoint and configure authentication.
   - Map GraphQL queries/mutations to Power Platform actions.
4. **Testing & Monitoring:**
   - Test authentication and data flows.
   - Monitor usage and set up alerts in Azure.

## Considerations
- Token lifetimes and refresh strategies.
- Least-privilege permissions for security.
- API throttling and error handling.
- Compliance with organizational policies.
