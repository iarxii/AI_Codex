# Sharing Documents with the LLM via the API: How-To & Considerations

## How-To
1. **Prepare the Document:**
   - Convert to plain text, PDF, or supported format.
   - Remove sensitive or unnecessary information.
2. **Upload or Reference the Document:**
   - Use your backend API to upload the file or provide a file path/URL.
   - Store metadata (owner, type, permissions, etc.).
3. **Send to LLM:**
   - For small docs, include content directly in the prompt.
   - For large docs, chunk the content and send in parts.
   - Use retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) if available.
4. **Handle Responses:**
   - Parse and display LLM output.
   - Store results or summaries as needed.

## Considerations
- **Privacy:** Never share confidential data without user consent.
- **Size Limits:** LLMs have context window limits (e.g., 8k, 32k tokens).
- **Chunking:** Split large docs and manage context overlap.
- **Security:** Validate file types and scan for malware.
- **Compliance:** Ensure data handling meets regulatory requirements (HIPAA, GDPR, etc.).

This is a non-exhaustive checklist. Adapt to your use case and LLM provider's API.
