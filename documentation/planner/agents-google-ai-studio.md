# Creating Specialized Agents with Google AI Studio

## Overview
Google AI Studio allows you to create, configure, and deploy custom AI agents using Gemini and other Google models. These agents can be tailored for specific tasks, domains, or workflows.

## Steps
1. **Access Google AI Studio:**
   - Go to https://makersuite.google.com/ or your organization's AI Studio portal.
2. **Create a New Agent:**
   - Choose a model (e.g., Gemini Pro, Gemini 1.5).
   - Define the agent's purpose and capabilities.
3. **Prompt Engineering:**
   - Write clear, structured prompts.
   - Use system instructions to guide agent behavior.
   - Test with sample inputs and iterate.
4. **Add Tools & Integrations:**
   - Connect APIs, data sources, or external tools as needed.
   - Configure authentication and permissions.
5. **Evaluation & Testing:**
   - Use built-in evaluation tools to test agent responses.
   - Collect feedback and refine prompts or settings.
6. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy as an API endpoint or integrate with your app.
   - Monitor usage and update as requirements evolve.

## Considerations
- Data privacy and compliance (especially with sensitive data).
- Rate limits and cost management.
- Versioning and change management for agent updates.
